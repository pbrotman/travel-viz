## Description

In June 2023, I quit my job to get life experiences I didn't have time for while working. I spent the following winter backpacking around Southeast Asia, from 5 December 2023 through 13 March 2024.

This project is a map of everywhere I traveled to. Each circle is a location I visited, and the lines represent my travel route.

#### Key:
- Circle area represents the number of nights spent at each location.
- Circle color represents country.
- Path style represents mode of transportation. (Solid black: land (incl. bus, van, train, motorbike), Dotted: boat, Grey: plane).
- Trip starts and ends in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

## Design decisions

Due to the limited scope of the data, and in order to maintain simplicity, I opted to store the data as json objects in external javascript files.
